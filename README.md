# Bubbles
This is a game in which the user is a bubble with a certain value. Other bubbles, which move around on the screen and bounce off the walls, have a mathematical value represented by an expression or integer, depending on the level. The user must "eat" bubbles of lesser value to increase his or her own bubble's value, and must eat all of the bubbles before the time runs out.
